This is an example of how to use the Strongbox artifact repository manager with Ant and Ivy.

# Before you start

Make sure that your Strongbox instance is up and running. If you are new to Strongbox, please visit the [Installation](https://strongbox.github.io/user-guide/getting-started.html) page first.

# Requirements

You will need the following software/jar installed on your machine to make this example working:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8.x or higher
* [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) version 1.9.14 or higher
* [Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/)

# The example project

The "Hello, World!" sample application for this can be found [here](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox-examples/tree/master/hello-strongbox-ant-ivy).

# Configurations

Following are minimal configuration in order to be able to use Ivy properly with Strongbox.

* Define an `IVY_HOME` variable pointing to the base directory of your Ivy installation.
* Set your `PATH`/`CLASSPATH` variable to include `$IVY_HOME/ivy-${IVY_VERSION}.jar`.

# The `build.xml` file

This is the Ant build script which compiles the code, produces a `jar` artifact and publishes (deploys) it to the Strongbox artifact repository.

# The `ivysettings.xml` file

This is where you define things like:
- `resolvers` : The repositories from which to resolve artifacta
- `publications` : Which artifacts to publish (deploy) to Strongbox

# The `ivy.xml` file

This is where you define:
* Your artifact's coordinates (via the `<info/>` tag)
* Your dependencies (via the `<dependencies/>` tag)

# The `credentials.properties` file

This file should be located under your `~/.ivy` directory and not be part of the project under version control. It contains the credentials for the repository to which you will be deploying.

# How to deploy

Execute the following command:

    ant build deploy

This will build the code and deploy it to Strongbox.
